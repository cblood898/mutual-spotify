        <p>  Sick of making your friends cry by asking why they listen to crappy music?
          Want to listen to music that everyone will enjoy but hate some of the music
          that comes on at the party or in the car with your friends? Use Jamify to solve
          that problem! Jamify will take the tracks from playlists that everyone likes!
          You decide who to invite to create a new Jamify playlist. Select a playlist
          to add tracks from and send the invite to your friends for them to add tracks
          from their playlists. Jamify will only add tracks to the newly created playlist
          that you both enjoy! So no more tears about music tastes!
